OBJECT-ORIENTED DESIGN CONCEPTS (JAVA)

This course introduces students to an object-oriented model of programming. By emphasizing design, this course shows how to implement small defect-free programs and evaluate design decisions to select an optimal design under specific assumptions. Topics include inheritance, exceptions, interface, design by contract, basic design patterns, and reuse. Students will be expected to design, implement, and debug object-oriented programs composed of multiple classes and over a variety of data structures.

Project 1 : FaceBuk | 
Creating and comparing objects.

Project 2 : LRU Cache | 
Creating and comparing Hash Maps and Lists.
  
Project 3 : IMDB BFS | 
A breathfirst search engine to find the shortest distance between each Actors who are linked by the movies they have been in. Actors are organized in a linked list that is created by parsing text files downloaded from the Internet Movie Database.

Project 4 : Zootopia | 
A JavaPane based game.

Project 5 : JavaPane & Expression Parser | 
This program accepts a algebraic argument [ex. 2+3+4x6]. The expression is parsed and displayed on the screen. Through use of Hboxes the user can then drag parts of the extression around to chage it [ex. 2+3+(5x6)+2 -> 3+(5x6)+2+2]. R2 is the compleated version of the program.
